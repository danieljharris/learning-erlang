As an example of ETS tables in use, lets look at the design of an index for a text document
well come back to this in later sections when we discuss how the data in the table can be accessed or traversed.
Specification: the document is a text file, and the index is required to show all the lines on which a particular word
appears. Words of fewer than four letters are ignored, and all the words in the document are normalized
to noncapitalized form in the index.
Consecutive lines are shown in the form of a range.
